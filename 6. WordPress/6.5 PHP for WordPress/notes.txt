PHP for WordPress

WordPress + PHP
	Save content to a database
	Read content from a database
	Write loops and conditional statements
	Pull in WordPress specific information
	Pull in images, PHP, CSS, and JavaScript files

PHP has three different types of files:

Core files - 	usually contain only php code and are not files
		that you should be editing since they might
		break your WordPress install.

Theme files - 	these contain a combination of php and html and
		are the most common types of files that you'll
		find yourself editing.

Plugin files -	these contain primarily php code although they
		may have some html, css and javascript mixed in
		with them. You do not generally edit plugin files
		unless you are building a plugin yourself.

You open and close a PHP block like this:

<?PHP

//php code goes here
echo "Hello WordPress!"

?>

or 

<?PHP echo "Hello WordPress!" ?>

codex.wordpress.org/template_tags - reference

(Psuedo code)

If (there are posts)
	echo post title
	echo post content

Else
	echo "sorry, no posts are available"
