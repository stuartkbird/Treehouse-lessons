html - hyper text markup language
is simply a set of tags we use to describe to the browser how our webpages are structured.
we do this by surrounding the content of our webpages with these html tags.

css - cascading style sheets
we use css to tell the browser what we want the content between the tags to look like.


Web development is often split into two areas, front end development and back end development.
Front end developers use html, css and javascript to build what the client sees.
The stuff that runs on the browser.

Back end developers are responsible for what runs on the server.
They use languages like python, ruby, and java to work with databases to save, change, and retrieve data.
